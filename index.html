<div class="description">Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), 
an underpaid, dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer.
 White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. 
 Breaking Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and concluded on September 29, 2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes.

<blockquote>Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr.
, and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent.
 Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut,
  and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, 
  and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive.</blockquote>

<strong>Breaking Bad's first season received generally positive reviews,</strong> while the subsequent seasons received unanimous critical acclaim, with praise for the performances, direction, cinematography, writing, story, and character development.
 Since its conclusion, the show has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. It has also developed a cult following.[7] The show had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. 
 Viewership increased exponentially upon the premiere of the second half of<em> the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television.</em>
